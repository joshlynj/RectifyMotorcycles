    2.  ```docker run --rm --name pg-docker -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -d -p 5432:5432 -v $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres```

    3. ```docker ps -a```
    
    4. Copy the container ID from the output

    5. ``` docker exec -it <PSQL-Container-ID> bash ```
3. Create a DB called " zork_db "

    ```dbcreate -U postgres zork_db```
